A project on using AI to make course prediction for students
THE IDEAL COURSE OR CAREER PATH PREDICTOR by    Douglas Daniel Mensah and William Agyemang-Yeboah

INTRODUCTION  
The question of the course to study when moving to senior high school or the university is always a headache for students especially in our part of the world. Parents who want their children to follow their example often force them to pursue courses of which they have no interest. Our education system does not emphasize on guiding students to select the right course of study after completing one level of education. This leads to students dropping out of school due to inability to keep up with course curriculums and people ending up in industries they have no interest in improving.  Some people have the opportunity to attend seminars where advice is given on the criteria to use to select the most suitable area of study, which will lead to a great career path. However, not everyone is fortunate enough to be exposed to this information. At the end of the day, this has a negative effect on our country and the world as a whole. This paper seeks to address this situation with the question, ‘Is it possible to have a quick and easy way to successfully predict the ideal course of study using information provided by students?’ This paper will attempt to answer this question by feeding information provided by students into an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to successfully predict the course of study and career path you are most likely to excel in. 

LITERATURE REVIEW  
According to an article on thetechedvocate.org, some universities like Georgia State and University of Arizona use machine learning to predict whether students are likely to abandon their studies or not based on their test scores and other factors. 
For example, Georgia State University learned that nursing students who did poorly in Introductory Math did not succeed in completing their course – only 10% of the students who got a C or lower in their math went on to graduate. Of the students who achieved B+ or better, 80% graduated.
These universities basically use these predictions to improve their student retention rates.
Many applications also apply AI in education. Some of these are:
1.	Alta: Knewton creates adaptive learning technology for higher education. Its program, called Alta, helps identify gaps in a student’s knowledge, provides relevant coursework and places students back on track for college-level courses. Alta also helps instructors teach at different educational levels and is currently used for math, chemistry, statistics and economics.
2.	COGNII: COGNII makes AI-based products for education institutions, as well as corporate training organizations. Its virtual learning assistant employs conversational technology to guide students in open-format responses that improve critical- thinking skills. The assistant also provides real-time feedback, one-on-one tutoring and is customized to each student’s needs.

IMPLEMENTATION  
A dataset was generated from a 1000 students stating their average exam scores over a period, their interests and skills. This information was then used to make predictions as to the right course to study at the next stage of your education (i.e. from JHS to SHS and from SHS to the university). A supervised machine learning algorithm called decision tree was used to train and test our existing data to make accurate predictions.
The tkinter command was used to create a graphic user interface for more user friendliness. A desktop and mobile application will be built for easy access by users.
